"Certainly! Below is the structured table format based on the given image analysis and instructions. This table includes the timestamp, the predicted object based on the highlighted area, and the predicted action.

### Table of Analysis:

| Timestamp | Object (Highlighted Area)         | Action Prediction                           |
|-----------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 4404      | White rectangular object           | Handling or installing the object           |

### CSV File Content:
```
Timestamp,Object (Highlighted Area),Action Prediction
4404,""White rectangular object"",""Handling or installing the object""
```

### Central Database Entry:

```json
Central Memory Station:
{
  ""data_entries"": [
    {
      ""timestamp"": 4404,
      ""object"": ""White rectangular object"",
      ""action_prediction"": ""Handling or installing the object""
    }
  ]
}
```

### Steps to Write into Memory and Show Results:

1. **Data Reception**: Receive the image data from the Expert Agent.
2. **Data Parsing**: Parse the image data to identify the highlighted area and the timestamp.
3. **Log Updates**: Based on the parsed data, update the log with the timestamp, predicted object, and action prediction.
4. **Store Data**: Store the structured data in a central database for future reference.
5. **Display Results**: Retrieve and display the stored data from the central database.

### Retrieving and Displaying Results:

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import json

# Sample data entry
data_entry = {
    ""timestamp"": 4404,
    ""object"": ""White rectangular object"",
    ""action_prediction"": ""Handling or installing the object""
}

# Central database storage (example: JSON file)
central_memory_station = {
    ""data_entries"": [data_entry]
}

# Writing the data to a CSV file (example: using Python's csv library)
import csv

with open('data_log.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow([""Timestamp"", ""Object (Highlighted Area)"", ""Action Prediction""])
    writer.writerow([data_entry[""timestamp""], data_entry[""object""], data_entry[""action_prediction""]])

# Displaying the results (example: printing the data)
print(""Central Database Entry:"")
print(json.dumps(central_memory_station, indent=4))
